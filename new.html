<p>1. What is Mycology?</p>
<div><p>A. The study of bacteria </p><br>
<p>B. The study of fungi</p><br>
<p>C. The study of viruses</p> <br>
<p>D. The study of plants</p><br>
</div>
<div><p>Answer: B. The study of fungi</p>
<p>Explanation: <b>Mycology </b>is the branch of biology that focuses on the study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use in medicine and food.</p>
</div>

<div><hr>
  <p>2. Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of fungi?</p><br>

  <p>A. Eukaryotic cells</p><br>
  <p>B. Photosynthetic</p><br>
  <p>C. Cell walls made of chitin</p><br>
  <p>D. Heterotrophic nutrition</p><br></div>
<div>
<p>Answer: B. Photosynthetic</p><br>
<p>Explanation: Fungi are heterotrophic organisms, meaning they obtain their nutrients by absorbing organic m
atter from other sources. They do not perform photosynthesis like plants.</p></div>
</div>
<div><hr>
<p>3. What structure do most fungi use for reproduction?</p><br>
<p>A. Spores</p><br>
<p>B. Seeds</p><br>
<p>C. Bulbs</p><br>
<p>D. Tubers</p><br>
<p>Answer: A. Spores</p>
<p>Explanation: Fungi primarily reproduce through spores, which can be produced sexually or asexually. These spores can disperse over long distances and germinate under favorable conditions to form new fungal organisms.</p>
</div><hr>
<p>4. Which type of fungus is known for forming symbiotic relationships with plant roots?
</p>
<p>A. Yeasts</p>
<p>B. Molds</p>
<p>C. Mycorrhizae</p>
<p>D. Lichens</p>
<p>Answer: C. Mycorrhizae</p>
<p>Explanation: Mycorrhizal fungi form beneficial associations with plant roots, enhancing nutrient uptake (especially phosphorus), while receiving carbohydrates from the plant in return.</p>
<hr><p>5.Which disease is caused by a fungal infection?</p>

<p>A. Tuberculosis</p>
<p>B. Athlete’s foot</p>
<p>C. Malaria</p>
<p>D. Influenza</p>
<p>>Answer: B. Athlete’s foot</p>
<p>Explanation: Athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) is a common fungal infection caused by dermatophytes that thrive in warm, moist environments, often affecting the skin between the toes.</p>
<p>6. What is the primary component of fungal cell walls?</p>

<p> A. Cellulose</p>
<p>B. Chitin</p>
<p>C. Peptidoglycan</p> 
<p>D. Lignin</p>  
<p>Answer: B. Chitin</p>
<p>Explanation: Fungal cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, a polysaccharide that provides structural strength, distinguishing them from plant cell walls which contain cellulose.</p>
<p>7. Which group of fungi includes species used in baking and brewing?</p>
<p>A. Zygomycetes</p> 
<p>B. Ascomycetes</p>
<p>C. Basidiomycetes</p>
<p>D. Glomeromycetes</p>
<p>Answer: B. Ascomycetes</p>
<p>Explanation: Ascomycetes, also known as sac fungi, include yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which are commonly used in baking and brewing due to their ability to ferment sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>8. What role do saprophytic fungi play in ecosystems?</p>
<p>A. They cause diseases in plants.</p>
<p>B. They decompose organic matter.</p>
<p>C. They produce antibiotics.</p>
<p>D. They enhance photosynthesis in plants.</p>
<p>Answer: B. They decompose organic matter.</p>
<p>Explanation: Saprophytic fungi feed on dead or decaying organic material, playing a crucial role in nutrient cycling and decomposition within ecosystems.</p>
<p>9. Lichens are a symbiotic association between which two organisms?</p>
<p>A. Algae and bacteria</p>
<p>B. Fungi and algae</p>
<p>C. Fungi and protozoa</p>
<p>D. Fungi and plants</p>
<p>Answer: B. Fungi and algae</p>
<p>Explanation: Lichens consist of a symbiotic relationship between fungi (usually ascomycetes or basidiomycetes ) and photosynthetic partners such as green algae or cyanobacteria, allowing them to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>10. Which antifungal medication targets ergosterol synthesis in fungal cell membranes?</p>
<p>A. Penicillin </p>
<p>B. Amphotericin B </p>
<p>C. Azoles </p>
<p>D. Tetracycline</p>
<p>Answer: C. Azoles</p>
<p>Explanation: Azoles are a class of antifungal agents that inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes, thereby disrupting membrane integrity and function.</p>
